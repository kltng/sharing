## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

# Chinese Studies Resources

The University of Toronto's East Asian collection originated with a group of rare Chinese materials brought to Canada in the 1930s. This has grown into a collection of over 300,000 research materials including monographs, serials, microforms, electronic resources, and audiovisual materials focused on humanities and social sciences. Our library now has one of the biggest Chinese academic collections in Canada, which serves University of Toronto users across all three campuses.

# Guide on Anti-Asian Racism: Asian Canadian History

### Introduction

TopWelcome to our research guide on anti-Asian racism in Canada. This guide is designed to provide starting points to learn about the histories and experiences of Asian Canadians and Asians in Canada since their first arrival in the late 1700s.

The guide includes a timeline of some key historical events in Asian Canadian history, a chronological list of resources from the University of Toronto Libraries on Asian Canadian history, and links to community supports around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the University of Toronto (U of T).

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

# Guide on Anti-Asian Racism: Asian Canadian History

### Introduction

TopWelcome to our research guide on anti-Asian racism in Canada. This guide is designed to provide starting points to learn about the histories and experiences of Asian Canadians and Asians in Canada since their first arrival in the late 1700s.

The guide includes a timeline of some key historical events in Asian Canadian history, a chronological list of resources from the University of Toronto Libraries on Asian Canadian history, and links to community supports around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the University of Toronto (U of T).

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

# Guide on Anti-Asian Racism: Asian Canadian History

### Introduction

TopWelcome to our research guide on anti-Asian racism in Canada. This guide is designed to provide starting points to learn about the histories and experiences of Asian Canadians and Asians in Canada since their first arrival in the late 1700s.

The guide includes a timeline of some key historical events in Asian Canadian history, a chronological list of resources from the University of Toronto Libraries on Asian Canadian history, and links to community supports around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the University of Toronto (U of T).

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

## **— Context —**

### Overview

For more than 200 years, Asian communities have made significant contributions to Canadian society, culture, and politics. However, these achievements must be understood alongside the many challenges wrought by anti-Asian racism.

This guide focuses on East Asian communities in Canada, which include those of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan heritage. We acknowledge that South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian communities are equally important and that their experiences may be similar to or unique from those of East Asian Canadians. Due to the interconnectedness and complexity of anti-Asian racism, some events and resources included in this guide may discuss their histories in Canada.

We also recognize that anti-Asian racism operates alongside and, at times, as an oppressive tool to facilitate anti-Indigenous racism, anti-Black racism, and ongoing settler colonialism. We hope that this guide will help raise awareness about and encourage reflective and critical engagement with these complex and ongoing issues.

### Notes on language

Where appropriate, names, titles, and other information may be presented in their original languages, Romanized form, and/or English translation.

Some Romanized terms may be specific to certain communities. For instance, among Japanese Canadians, *issei* refers to first-generation Japanese immigrants to the Americas, *nisei* to the second generation, and *sansei* to the third generation.

Some primary-source materials may include discriminatory and racist language that is reflective of the climate of their time of writing. The Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library does not condone such language or views, and these resources are highlighted for informational and research purposes.

### Timeline

The following timeline highlights just some of those racially-charged events across Canada, and especially in Ontario.

Please see our [extended timeline](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#extended-timeline) and [references](/resources/anti-asian-racism-resource-guide/further-information#references) if you are interested in learning more.

# Chinese Studies Resources

The University of Toronto's East Asian collection originated with a group of rare Chinese materials brought to Canada in the 1930s. This has grown into a collection of over 300,000 research materials including monographs, serials, microforms, electronic resources, and audiovisual materials focused on humanities and social sciences. Our library now has one of the biggest Chinese academic collections in Canada, which serves University of Toronto users across all three campuses.
